Instructions that go to the ALU must be 56 bits. These bits are allocated as follows:
|--opcode--|--oa1 type--|----------oa1----------|--oa2 type--|----------oa2----------|
   4 bit       2 bits            24 bits            2 bits            24 bits

opcode:
 * Enumeration of instruction
 * Solely decides for which instruction the control unit sends a signal to the ALU
 * 0x0 -- 0xF

oa1/2 type (operand 1/2 type):
 * Control unit will AND this signal with wires to decide whether to load information into the ALU from
   registers or memory or an immediate
 * 0x1: IMMEDIATE
 * 0x2: REGISTER
 * 0x3: INTEGER LITERAL
 * 0x0 -- 0x3

oa1/2 (operand 1/2):
 * registers: 0x000000 to 0x00000F
 * immediates and literals: 0x000000 to 0xFFFFFF

Note on assembler: must store all fields in LITTLE endian
