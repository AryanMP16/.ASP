Instructions that go to the ALU must be 64 bits. These bits are allocated as follows:
|--opcode--|--oa1 type--|----------oa1----------|--oa2 type--|----------oa2----------|------ blank ------|
   4 bit       2 bits            16 bits            2 bits            16 bits               20 bits

opcode:
 * Enumeration of instruction
 * Solely decides for which instruction the control unit sends a signal to the ALU
 * 0x0 -- 0xF

oa1/2 type (operand 1/2 type):
 * Control unit will AND this signal with wires to decide whether to load information into the ALU from
   registers or memory or an immediate
 * 0x0 -- 0x3

oa1/2 (operand 1/2):
 * Registers are 16 bits. This is a 16-bit computer. Therefore all operands must be at most 16 bits
 * 0x0000 -- 0xFFFF

blank:
 * 20 bits of only 0x0s

Note on assembler: must store all fields in LITTLE endian
