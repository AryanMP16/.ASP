This code is set up to support any ISA that meets the following requirements:
 * There exist 4 types of tokens: instructions, registers, immediates, integer literals
 * Registers must be:
   - rax
   - rsp
   - rip
   - r1 -- r12
 * Immediates must begin with prefix '$'
 * All immediates and integer literals must be in hex, with prefix '0x'
 * There must be at most 16 instructions

This means that:
 * Instructions may have as long a name (string representation) as desired (i.e. it's ok to have "ADD" and "ADDI", despite 1 being 3 characters and the other being 4)
 * Instructions may have as many operands as desired, as long as they are of the type of tokens allowed
